881;The reason you may not see as many policies and a uncaring attitude from conservatives is that thier platform is/was for smaller government (at least it was a few decades ago) and letting individual states decide rather then tell everyone what must be done in the name of the federal government.;Assumption;Assumption

Two distinctions, the server probably doesn't own the business, and providing food doesn't directly contribute to premarital sex like, say, selling a condom does.;Assumption;Assumption
922;Providing food directly contributes to feeding them, and what they do afterwards is largely unrelated to service at a restaurant.;Assumption;Assumption

1059;I'm not saying any of these are good arguments - in fact I think they're bad arguments and that polygamy should be legal.;None;Assumption
1060;But my point is that these arguments are specific to polygamy and are not answered by the arguments for gay marriage.;Assumption;Assumption
1061;Morally, sure, they are closely linked.;Assumption;Assumption
1062;There may be reasons for monogamy over polygamy, but the big issue is the legal logistics.;Assumption;Assumption

1069;You don't have to label one spouse the man and the other the woman anymore, so gay marriage is reasonable and no reason other than religious to ban it.;None;Assumption
1070;But polygamy has logistics beyond gender.;Assumption;Assumption
1071;If we consider marriage to be a partnership between equals then I think the comparison breaks down.;Assumption;None
1072;Two gay people can have an equal partnership just as easily as two straight people, but with heterosexual polygamous relationships things get more complicated.;Assumption;Assumption
1073;Typically these relationships involve a single person of one sex (usually male) with several members of the opposite sex competing for their attention to some extent.;Assumption;Definition
1074;I'd argue that this type of relationship is inherently unequal, with some members having disproportionately more power than the others.;Assumption;Assumption

1086;The arguments in favor of gay marriage do not negate all the arguments against polygamy.;Assumption;Assumption
1087;"&gt;That being said, a relationship between a gay couple should be able to advance to marriage status because they should have the same right to access the benefits of marriage as a straight couple.";None;Assumption
1088;However, since poly relationships have more than 2 people, they are incompatible with the already established institution of marriage, so it should not be legal.;None;Assumption
1089;I think traditionally, a straight couple would be recognized by society (whit the institution of marriage) mostly to help incentivize people to take care of the next generation.;Assumption;Assumption

1091;You are generally correct that arguments that support gay marriage also apply to plural marriage (I will avoid using the word polygamy, as it specifically means 1 husband with multiple wives).;None;None

1224;This guys going for the long con sure but I think he's got his immortality in mind.;Assumption;Assumption
1225;Trump is using trolling techniques to do well in our political process.;Assumption;Assumption
1226;He says provocative things with just enough plausible deniability that it doesn't eliminate him.;Assumption;Assumption
1227;He is Extremely successful at this.;None;Assumption
1228;"The question of ""whether he wants to be President"" is largely irrelevant.";None;Assumption
1229;He put forth a strategy that served him well and it's incredibly fair to say it's a trolly strategy.;Assumption;Assumption
1230;I don't think he's trolling at all.;None;Assumption
1231;"Remember, Trump was perhaps the most vocal ""birther"" an entire election cycle ago.";Anecdote;Assumption
1232;He even hired private detectives to try to discover something damning about Obama.;Anecdote;Anecdote
1233;Obama, though, had the last laugh when he [roasted Trump's antics during the correspondants dinner -- right to his face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eJpWOY3r18).;Anecdote;Anecdote

1235;He's squirming.;None;Assumption
1236;"He is used to being the big man and ""yes men"" stroking his already-inflated ego.";Assumption;Anecdote
1237;Instead, the entire room was all laughing at him, belittling him.;Assumption;Assumption
1238;That wasn't the reaction of someone who was just trolling, it was the reaction of someone who'd just been embarrassed for his outrageous beliefs.;Assumption;Assumption
1239;Those extreme beliefs are only reinforced by the fact that his long-time butler is a [known racist and fervent Obama-hater](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/13/donald-trumps-butler-problem/).;Anecdote;Assumption
1240;While these extreme positions may seem like an example of [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law), I assure you, Trump clearly holds those convictions.;Assumption;Statistics/Study
1241;I think his staff are trolling.;None;Assumption
1242;I think Trump is genuine in his weird sort of way, but the people who rise quickly in his staff are the morbidly sarcastic type who would try to slide in a Rickroll reference and a plagiarized first lady speech.;None;Assumption
1243;According to people who know him, Trump is a narcissist who feeds on attention.;Testimony;Anecdote
1244;So yes, his entire campaign is just him feeding his narcissism by any means necessary.;Assumption;Assumption
1245;I don't know if that is the same thing as trolling.;None;None
1246;But it is in the same ballpark.;None;Assumption
1247;The same thought has crossed my mind, but as of right now I'm more inclined to believe that his whole campaign is just a tool to promote his businesses.;None;Assumption
1248;The constant book references and the comments he made at his golf club among other things point to the run being a racket.;Assumption;Anecdote
1249;Being president seems like an additional bonus to him rather than a necessity.;None;Assumption
1250;I can understand where you're coming from but that's just a natural reaction.;None;None
1251;When you see someone being so outrageous and **stupid**, to the point you can barely comprehend a human being could *genuinely be that far gone*, your immediate instinct is to go the opposite direction, and apply an unwarranted intelligence, some ulterior motive.;Assumption;Assumption
1252;*Something* to avoid the uncomfortable psychological dissonance of having to accept the previously unacceptable fact that some people really are just that hopeless.;Assumption;Assumption
1253;If Trump is some super-genius troll then he has been doing it since he first opened his mouth.;Assumption;Assumption
1254;He's been a complete muppet since long before his presidential run, I should know, my local community had the misfortune of attracting this man's attentions, and the sheer amount of bullshit he brings with him.;Assumption;Anecdote
1255;It's not just that he riles people up.;Assumption;Assumption
1256;He's genuinely a *bad person*.;None;Assumption
1257;"Although it's arguable trolls (people trying to incite a reaction usually one of upset and negative attention) aren't counted up there with ""good people"".";None;Assumption
1258;He wants the presidency, because that's Trump's personality to a T. When he decides he wants something he'll go full bent for it and damned be consequences, common sense or even common decency.;Assumption;Assumption
1259;He's a narcissist of the highest order so in his mind *of course* he deserves the presidency, and it'll only be natural if he gets it.;Assumption;Assumption
1260;"Not here to challenge your view just to let you know that using a double negative in your title ""non-insubstanial is incredibly confusing and poor writing!";None;None

1263;He's been consistent and clear on his opinion of what is wrong with America and what needs to change... For the last 36 Years.;Assumption;Assumption
1264;He has said the same thing since the 80's... no one listened.;Assumption;Anecdote
1265;So it finally got bad enough that he's going to do exactly what he said he would do, for the last 36 years... and Fix it himself.;Assumption;Anecdote

1267;Essentially you'd have to believe this is a troll he's been working for the better part of 4 Decades, one that he'd sacrifice 18 months of his life and business, to run on the campaign trail.;Anecdote;Assumption
1268;One that he'd feel was worth tens of millions in personal funds.;None;Assumption
1269;One that would be worth being labeled a Racist, Misogynist,  Anti-Semite, Zenophone, Bigot, and more...;None;Assumption
1270;"The man has been called ""Literally Hitler"".";None;Anecdote
1271;No troll is worth that.;Assumption;Assumption
1272;It looks like the discussion has already run it's course and your view has changed..;None;Assumption
1273;I just wanted to say that the reason trolling works is because there is a small chance the person is being serious and is just a little off or completely oblivious.;Assumption;Assumption
1274;In other words, if someone says the moon is made of cheese, they aren't trolling because everyone knows that nobody in their right mind believes the moon is made of cheese.;Assumption;Assumption
1275;However, if someone says the moon landing was a hoax, it's possible they believe it because we know others do really believe that.;Assumption;Assumption
1276;The things Trump are saying seem trolly because there are people delusional enough to believe the things he claims to believe.;Assumption;Assumption
1277;We just don't want to believe a successful businessman and celebrity would believe things reserved for village idiots.;Assumption;Assumption
1278;So when Trump says something absurd, you have to choose between two conclusions, this successful popular businessman is brutally ignorant of reality, or this successful popular businessman is just trolling.;Assumption;Assumption
1279;The more successful popular people you meet, the more you'll understand that the concept of them being massively ignorant is well within the realm of possibility and not really surprising at all.;Assumption;Assumption

1288;"lol, i was just talking about this with my girlfriend last night about the chances trump is just fucking with people and that it'd actually completely change my view of him if whenever he's either elected or loses, he ""removes the mask"" to reveal just how racist and gullible people are.";Anecdote;Anecdote
